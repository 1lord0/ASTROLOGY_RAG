It is the fourth planet from the Sun (about 141 1⁄4 million miles away). Mars is about half the size of the Earth, with a diameter of 4,200 miles compared to Earth’s 8,000 miles.

OPPOSITION /L52392One of the major aspects, in which two or more planets are opposite each other in a horoscope, i.e., separated by 180° (or within 9° either way of 180°). The traditional view of an opposition in a chart is that it is an unharmonious aspect, one that produces tension and conﬂict. The modern view is that an opposition also brings challenge for growth and achievement, because the native must work through his or her problems and con- ﬂicts and thus gain maturity.
